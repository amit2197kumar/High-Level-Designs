# An introduction to distributed systems

Take an example of a pizza restaurant in real life and examine how it can scale from a single store with a single chef to multiple stores - compare that with a software system that is needed to be scaled

**What is Systems Design?**

Systems design uses computer engineering principles to build large-scale distributed systems. It involves converting business problems and requirements into technical solutions. Senior engineers use system design patterns to make reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.

Tips/terms used by engineers when designing systems:
1. Vertical scaling - 1st action
2. Preprocessing using cron jobs - for non-urgent job, for pre-processing
3. Backup servers - Master/Slave
4. Horizontal scaling - Adding in parallel
5. Microservices 
6. Distributed Systems
7. Load Balancing
8. Decoupling
9. Logging and metrics calculation
10. Extensibility
