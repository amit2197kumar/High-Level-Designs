Availability is the probability that a system will be available to preform its function when called upon.

And availability in its simplest form is the measure of uptime (the amount of time the system is performing its mission) divided by the uptime plus downtime (the amount of time the system is not performing its mission):

**Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)**

## The "Nines" of Availability (Measurement of Availability)

In high-demand applications that are commonly in service 24/7, the availability is frequently measured by the number of “nines.” If availability is 99.0 percent, it is stated to be “2 nines,” and if it is 99.9 percent, it is called “3 nines,” and so on. The amount of downtime a system exhibits within one year (365 days) of continuous (24/7) desired operation and its associated number of nines, which are calculated using this formula:

Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)

High Availability is important, it should be noted that it's difficult to achieve that and comes with its own trade off and its non-trivial. High Availability might come at other cost like higher latencies or lower throughput. In a system some part might require High Availability, some part might not.

Example: PayPal's payments service need to have high availability, but their dashboard might not require that high availability.

How to make a system Available : System shouldn’t have a single point of failures.

Now how we reduce a single point of failures in the system: With Redundancy (Act of duplicating, triplicating or even more copy of same part of the system)

Load balancer are used in large part of systems to reduce the single point of failures.

Redundancy can be added in parts of systems by literally just adding more machines to those part of systems.
