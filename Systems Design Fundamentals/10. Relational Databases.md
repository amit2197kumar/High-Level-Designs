## Database Indexes

Check about Database Indexes here: [https://systemdesignbasic.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/database-indexes/](https://systemdesignbasic.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/database-indexes/)

### **Advantages of Indexing**

1. It helps you to reduce the total number of I/O operations needed to retrieve that data, so you don’t need to access a row in the database from an index structure.
2. Offers Faster search and retrieval of data to users.
3. Indexing also helps you to reduce tablespace as you don’t need to link to a row in a table, as there is no need to store the ROWID in the Index. Thus you will able to reduce the tablespace.
4. You can’t sort data in the lead nodes as the value of the primary key classifies it.

### **Disadvantages of Indexing**

1. To perform the indexing database management system, you need a primary key on the table with a unique value.
2. You can’t perform any other indexes on the Indexed data.
3. You are not allowed to partition an index-organized table.
4. SQL Indexing Decrease performance in INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE query.
