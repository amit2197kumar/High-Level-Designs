**Protocol:** A protocol is just an agreed upon set of rules for an interaction between two parties. 

Modern day systems are made up of clients and servers that communicate or interact with each other following a network protocol.

Network protocol consists of:

1. Type of messages that gonna be sent over the network.
2. The format of those messages, how they are structured.
3. The order of those messages.
4. Wether or not there should be some sort of response to a message.

There are a lot of protocol out there, the one that are important and we will discuss are:

1. IP : Internet Protocol 
2. TCP : Transmission Control Protocol 
3. HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol
